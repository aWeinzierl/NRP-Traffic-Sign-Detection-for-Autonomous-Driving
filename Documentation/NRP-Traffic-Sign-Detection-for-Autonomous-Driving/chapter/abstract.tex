In this project, we intend to implement the visual-based traffic sign detection for autonomous driving on Neurorobotics Platform(NRP). For the traffic sign detection part, a street model with traffic signs is setup in NRP and a small dataset of 3 traffic signs is used to train a pre-trained CNN.  We use the Husky robot as the car model, which has a camera mounted on it. Traffic signs in the images obtained from the robot's camera will be classified and localized. Finally, the car will adjust its motion according to the classification result of the closest traffic sign.
