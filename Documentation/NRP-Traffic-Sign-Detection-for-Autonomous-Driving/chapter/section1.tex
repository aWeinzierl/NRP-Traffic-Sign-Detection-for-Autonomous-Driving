\subsection{Cognitive Functions}
list of cognitive functions mentioned in the exercise:

perception and attention
percetpion: camera
attention: does the neural network do something like that?

memory and knowledge
information stored in neural network weight: knowledge about the world: how do certain signs look like, how to distinguish them from each other and from background
information stored in programmed behaviour: programmed reactions to sign detection, how to control the motors, etc

learning and development
learning: in neural network training (although not closed loop in current setup)
delelopment: no, ``body'' stays the same

autonomy
very limited: can react to signs on road and drive safely on such a road without supervision, but can't adapt do other environments

social cognititon
no

conciousness
unlikely

\subsection{Cognition Model (Cognitivist or Emergent)}
visual traffic sign detection: emergent, neural networks...
motor control: cognitivist: rule based
