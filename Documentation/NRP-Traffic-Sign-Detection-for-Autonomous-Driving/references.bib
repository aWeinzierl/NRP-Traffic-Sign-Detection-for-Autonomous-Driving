abstract={The aim of the neurorobotic platform of the Human Brain Project is to offer scientists and technology developers a software and hardware infrastructure that allows them to connect prevalidated brain models to detailed simulations of robot bodies and environments, and to use the resulting neurorobotic systems in insilico experiments and technology development. The first version of this platform has been released in March 2016 and is described in this contribution.},
